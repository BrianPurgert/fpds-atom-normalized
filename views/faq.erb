      <div class="accordion-header">Why is FPDS.gov being decommissioned?</div>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is consolidating federal acquisition data systems into SAM.gov as part of a modernization effort. FPDS.gov's ezSearch was decommissioned on February 24, 2026, with the Atom feed following later in FY2026. All procurement data search capabilities are transitioning to <a href="https://sam.gov/fpds" target="_blank">SAM.gov</a>.</p>
